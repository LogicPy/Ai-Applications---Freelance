## About The Project

The **AI Vulnerability Scanner** is a powerful tool designed to detect and classify security vulnerabilities in web applications. Leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), this scanner analyzes textual input and URLs to identify potential security threats such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Path Traversal, and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

Built with Flask, TensorFlow, and various NLP libraries, this scanner provides an intuitive web interface for users to perform vulnerability assessments effortlessly.

## Features

- **Automated Vulnerability Detection:** Identifies common web vulnerabilities with high accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive web UI for easy interactions.
- **Real-Time Scanning:** Provides instant feedback on the security status of your inputs.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add new vulnerability types and enhance existing models.
- **Selenium Integration:** Automates browser interactions for comprehensive scanning.
